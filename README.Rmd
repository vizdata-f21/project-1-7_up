## Introduction

Our dataset comes from the Urban Institute and US Census and focuses on racial 
wealth inequality. We chose this dataset because wealth inequality is a very 
important issue in America, and it would be valuable to see the relationship 
between race and wealth over time in America. There are around 5-6 data files 
focused on the relationship between race and income over time. 

For the purpose of answering the two questions below, we will be focusing on the 
`home_owner` and `income_mean` data sets. The `home_owner` data set will help us 
to visualize home-ownership rate information for each race while the `income_mean` 
dataset will help us to visualize the income earned for each income quintile for 
each race during a particular time period.

## 1. How has home-ownership rate and wealth changed over time and vary between races?

### Introduction

(1-2 paragraphs)
Introduction to the question and what parts of the dataset are necessary to answer the question. Also discuss why you’re interested in this question.

We want to investigate how homeownership rates have changed over time, and how 
homeownership trends vary by race. We are interested in understanding 
homeownership trends across racial groups because homeownership is one of the 
biggest contributors to racial wealth inequality. We decided to use the 
`home_owner` dataset and use the `year`, `race`, and `home_owner_pct` variables
because they will allow us to plot homeownership percentages by race over time.

When it comes to home ownership in the US, a major event that has shaped our
parents’ lives and even ours to a certain extent was the great recession around
2009 and the housing bubble caused by faulty mortgages. For this context, we 
wanted to explore changes in homeownership percentage a few years before and 
after the crash and see which races have been particularly affected by it more.
For this, we used the`home_owner` dataset and use the `year`, `race`, and 
`home_owner_pct` variables.


### Approach

(1-2 paragraphs)
As previously mentioned, apart from just a line plot, the grouped barplot does
an efficient job in comparing 3 different variables where one is categorical.
When making an animated plot, the benefit of a grouped barplot is that it makes 
it very easy to see the exact percentages over time, which is ideal to see the 
exact changes in homeownership percentages across the years and racial groups. 

When it comes to plotting information from 3 different variables, that includes
a categorical variable, some of the most efficient plots would be a line plot 
and barplot. Line plots are best for displaying the change of a value, such as
homeownership percentage, over the course of time. Thus, we used a line plot to
plot the change of homeownership percentages by different racial groups 
(White, Hispanic, Black) from 1976-2016.

### Analysis

(2-3 code blocks, 2 figures, text/code comments as needed)
In this section, provide the code that generates your plots. Use scale functions to provide nice axis labels and guides.
You are welcome to use theme functions to customize the appearance of your plot, but you are not required to do so.
All plots must be made with ggplot2. Do not use base R or lattice plotting functions.


```{r find-peaks, include = F}

  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(mean_pct_unweighted = mean(home_owner_pct)) %>%
  arrange(mean_pct_unweighted) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  pull(year)

highest_year <- home_owner %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(mean_pct_unweighted = mean(home_owner_pct)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_pct_unweighted)) %>%

### Discussion

(1-3 paragraphs)

The line plot shows that there is a consistent racial disparity in homeownership
percentages between Whites and Hispanics and Whites and Blacks. Upwards of 65%
of White Americans have consistently owned homes from 1976-2016. Meanwhile, for
the same years, lower than 50% of Hispanics and Blacks have owned homes. After
2005, a greater percentage of Hispanics own homes compared to Blacks. There are
many possible reasons for the racial disparity in homeownership rates such as 
the fact that White families tend to have greater wealth than Hispanic and Black
families and that White individuals are more likely to receive inheritances than
other minority groups which can be used for home down payments (Bhutta et al.).


Around 2007, the homeownership percentages started to decrease across all racial
groups(Black, Hispanic, White), which makes sense as it was the start of when
there were a lot of foreclosures. Treating 2007 as the baseline, it is apparent
that hispanic and black communities were significantly more affected by the 
foreclosures than white communities. This is apparent from the bar chart as 
there is a larger decrease in homeownership percentages for the two racial 
groups compared to the white demographic. Through the animated grouped bar 
chart, it can be noticed that for the most part that homeownership percentages
have not gone back to the levels at which it was before the housing bubble, 
based on the most recent data collected at 2016.

## 2. How do household income levels compare between races and within each race?

### Introduction

Most income inequality research focuses on the income disparity between 
different races, for example, how Asian Americans and White Americans typically 
have higher income as compared to African Americans and Hispanic/Latino 
Americans. There is significantly less research focusing on the income 
disparities within each of the races. We are trying to figure out the degree of 
income inequality for each of the races within their own community.
In this question, we will be using `income_mean.csv`. This data set is 
sufficient since it provides us with the income information for each household 
quintile, year, and race. We will be using the following variables: `year`, 
`race`, `income_quintile`, and `income_dollars` which will be explained further 
in the "Approach" section.

### Approach

**Average income distribution by race has changed over time.** We chose a
***line plot*** and decided to facet by race with year on the x axis and average 
income amount on the y axis. We cared less about looking into specific years and 
more about overall trends and comparisons within each race. To clean the data 
for this visualization, we filtered out race categories that included 
combinations and the “all” category. This left us with 4 levels: Whites, Blacks, 
Hispanics, and Asians. We wanted to highlight the top earners in each racial 
category- so we colored them in red. Something interesting to note is that data 
collection for Asian observations only started around 2000. It is hard to easily 
compare differences between races, so we decided to zoom into 2019 and make a 
bar chart.

**Average income for each income quintile by race.** We chose a bar 
***bar graph*** because we are trying to compare how much more the top 20% of 
earners mae than those who make less for each racial group, and understand which 
race has the highest gap (through a stacked filled bar chart). A bar graph is 
ideal since we can group or stack them together and color them based on the 
income quintile variable, making the visualization easier to be understood by 
readers.

### Discussion

From the 1st plot, we found that those who are Asian tended to have the highest 
average income, and their top 20% made far more than the other racial groups. 
Overtime, income disparities in all the racial categories increased when 
considering the top 20% of income earners. This increase in disparity seemed to 
be most noticeable for White households. We suspect that generally income is the 
highest among Asians due to their high educational attainment on average, and 
lowest in Black individuals due to the systemic disadvantages they have 
experienced throughout U.S. history.

From the 2nd plot, we can roughly surmise that income inequality is the highest 
within Black households and lowest within Hispanic households. Our speculation 
is that income inequality is highest among the Black category on average, 
because of lack of high-paying jobs and opportunities for Black individuals 
living in the rural Southern States vs. those living in Northeastern or 
Midwestern urban areas. For Asians, we speculate that income inequality is 
higher than Hispanics due to the different migration patterns and sources that 
Asian Americans' ancestors came from. For example, Indian and Chinese Americans 
have a high proportion of professional college-educated citizens, while a lot of 
Southeast Asian Americans are doing blue-collared jobs and many came to the 
United States as refugees from less wealthy backgrounds.
