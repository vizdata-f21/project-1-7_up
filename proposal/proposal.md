## Dataset

A brief description of your dataset including its provenance,
dimensions, etc. as well as the reason why you chose this dataset.

Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this
information.

The dataset comes from the Urban Institute and US Census and focuses on
racial wealth inequality. We chose this dataset because wealth
inequality is a very important issue in America, and it would be
valuable to see the relationship between race and wealth over time in
America. There are around 5-6 data files focused on the relationship
between race and income over time. There are also important files on the
relationship between race and retirement, homeownership, and student
debt.

## Questions

The two questions you want to answer.

**Question 1: ** How do wealth and income distribution across different
racial groups has changed over time?

In general, we hypothesize that the gap between different racial groups
gradually decreases over time.

ACROSS DIFFERENT RACES (time series)

**Question 2: ** The second question we would like to explore is to see
how homeownership and student debt loans has changed over time among
different racial groups.

WITHIN RACE (probably not time series - take the most recent)

## Analysis plan

A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables
involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged
in (if any).
